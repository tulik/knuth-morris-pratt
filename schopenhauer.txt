It would be a good thing to buy books if one could also buy the time toread them; but one usually confuses the purchase of books with the+acquisition of their contents. To desire that a man should retaineverything he has ever read, is the same as wishing him to retain in his+stomach all that he has ever eaten. He has been bodily nourished on whathe has eaten, and mentally on what he has read, and through them become+what he is. As the body assimilates what is homogeneous to it, so will aman _retain_ what _interests_ him; in other words, what coincides with+his system of thought or suits his ends. Every one has aims, but veryfew have anything approaching a system of thought. This is why such+people do not take an objective interest in anything, and why they learnnothing from what they read: they remember nothing about it.+_Repetitio est mater studiorum_. Any kind of important book should+immediately be read twice, partly because one grasps the matter in itsentirety the second time, and only really understands the beginning when+the end is known; and partly because in reading it the second time one'stemper and mood are different, so that one gets another impression; it+may be that one sees the matter in another light.+Works are the quintessence of a mind, and are therefore always of by fargreater value than conversation, even if it be the conversation of the+greatest mind. In every essential a man's works surpass his conversationand leave it far behind. Even the writings of an ordinary man may be+instructive, worth reading, and entertaining, for the simple reason thatthey are the quintessence of that man's mind--that is to say, the+writings are the result and fruit of his whole thought and study; whilewe should be dissatisfied with his conversation. Accordingly, it is+possible to read books written by people whose conversation would giveus no satisfaction; so that the mind will only by degrees attain high+culture by finding entertainment almost entirely in books, and not inmen.+There is nothing that so greatly recreates the mind as the works of the+old classic writers. Directly one has been taken up, even if it is onlyfor half-an-hour, one feels as quickly refreshed, relieved, purified,+elevated, and strengthened as if one had refreshed oneself at a mountainstream. Is this due to the perfections of the old languages, or to the+greatness of the minds whose works have remained unharmed and untouchedfor centuries? Perhaps to both combined. This I know, directly we stop+learning the old languages (as is at present threatening) a new class ofliterature will spring up, consisting of writing that is more barbaric,+stupid, and worthless than has ever yet existed; that, in particular,the German language, which possesses some of the beauties of the old+languages, will be systematically spoilt and stripped by these worthlesscontemporary scribblers, until, little by little, it becomes+impoverished, crippled, and reduced to a miserable jargon.+Half a century is always a considerable time in the history of theuniverse, for the matter which forms it is always shifting; something is+always taking place. But the same length of time in literature oftengoes for nothing, because nothing has happened; unskilful attempts don't+count; so that we are exactly where we were fifty years previously.+To illustrate this: imagine the progress of knowledge among mankind inthe form of a planet's course. The false paths the human race soon+follows after any important progress has been made represent theepicycles in the Ptolemaic system; after passing through any one of them+the planet is just where it was before it entered it. The great minds,however, which really bring the race further on its course, do not+accompany it on the epicycles which it makes every time. This explainswhy posthumous fame is got at the expense of contemporary fame, and+_vice versa_. We have an instance of such an epicycle in the philosophyof Fichte and Schelling, crowned by Hegel's caricature of it. This+epicycle issued from the limit to which philosophy had been finallybrought by Kant, where I myself took it up again later to carry it+further. In the interim the false philosophers I have mentioned, andsome others, passed through their epicycle, which has just been+terminated; hence the people who accompanied them are conscious of beingexactly at the point from which they started.+This condition of things shows why the scientific, literary, and+artistic spirit of the age is declared bankrupt about every thirtyyears. During that period the errors have increased to such an extent+that they fall under the weight of their absurdity; while at the sametime the opposition to them has become stronger. At this point there is+a crash, which is followed by an error in the opposite direction. Toshow the course that is taken in its periodical return would be the true+practical subject of the history of literature; little notice is takenof it, however. Moreover, through the comparative shortness of such+periods, the data of remote times are with difficulty collected; hencethe matter can be most conveniently observed in one's own age. An+example of this taken from physical science is found in Werter'sNeptunian geology. But let me keep to the example already quoted above,+for it is nearest to us. In German philosophy Kant's brilliant periodwas immediately followed by another period, which aimed at being+imposing rather than convincing. Instead of being solid and clear, itaimed at being brilliant and hyperbolical, and, in particular,+unintelligible; instead of seeking truth, it intrigued. Under thesecircumstances philosophy could make no progress. Ultimately the whole+school and its method became bankrupt. For the audacious, sophisticatednonsense on the one hand, and the unconscionable praise on the other of+Hegel and his fellows, as well as the apparent object of the wholeaffair, rose to such a pitch that in the end the charlatanry of the+thing was obvious to everybody; and when, in consequence of certainrevelations, the protection that had been given it by the upper classes+was withdrawn, it was talked about by everybody. This most miserable ofall the philosophies that have ever existed dragged down with it into+the abyss of discredit the systems of Fichte and Schelling, which hadpreceded it. So that the absolute philosophical futility of the first+half of the century following upon Kant in Germany is obvious; and yetthe Germans boast of their gift for philosophy compared with foreigners,+especially since an English writer, with malicious irony, called them _anation of thinkers_.+Those who want an example of the general scheme of epicycles taken from+the history of art need only look at the School of Sculpture whichflourished in the last century under Bernini, and especially at its+further cultivation in France. This school represented commonplacenature instead of antique beauty, and the manners of a French minuet+instead of antique simplicity and grace. It became bankrupt when, underWinckelmann's direction, a return was made to the antique school.+Another example is supplied in the painting belonging to the firstquarter of this century. Art was regarded merely as a means and+instrument of mediaeval religious feeling, and consequentlyecclesiastical subjects alone were chosen for its themes. These,+however, were treated by painters who were wanting in earnestness offaith, and in their delusion they took for examples Francesco Francia,+Pietro Perugino, Angelico da Fiesole, and others like them, even holdingthem in greater esteem than the truly great masters who followed. In+view of this error, and because in poetry an analogous effort had at thesame time met with favour, Goethe wrote his parable _Pfaffenspiel_. This+school, reputedly capricious, became bankrupt, and was followed by areturn to nature, which made itself known in _genre_ pictures and scenes+of life of every description, even though it strayed sometimes intovulgarity.+It is the same with the progress of the human mind in the _history of+literature_, which is for the most part like the catalogue of a cabinetof deformities; the spirit in which they keep the longest is pigskin. We+do not need to look there for the few who have been born shapely; theyare still alive, and we come across them in every part of the world,+like immortals whose youth is ever fresh. They alone form what I havedistinguished as _real_ literature, the history of which, although poor+in persons, we learn from our youth up out of the mouths of educatedpeople, and not first of all from compilations. As a specific against+the present prevailing monomania for reading literary histories, so thatone may be able to chatter about everything without really knowing+anything, let me refer you to a passage from Lichtenberg which is wellworth reading (vol. ii. p. 302 of the old edition).+But I wish some one would attempt a _tragical history of literature_,+showing how the greatest writers and artists have been treated duringtheir lives by the various nations which have produced them and whose+proudest possessions they are. It would show us the endless fight whichthe good and genuine works of all periods and countries have had to+carry on against the perverse and bad. It would depict the martyrdom ofalmost all those who truly enlightened humanity, of almost all the great+masters in every kind of art; it would show us how they, with fewexceptions, were tormented without recognition, without any to share+their misery, without followers; how they existed in poverty and miserywhilst fame, honour, and riches fell to the lot of the worthless; it+would reveal that what happened to them happened to Esau, who, whilehunting the deer for his father, was robbed of the blessing by Jacob+disguised in his brother's coat; and how through it all the love oftheir subject kept them up, until at last the trying fight of such a+teacher of the human race is ended, the immortal laurel offered to him,and the time come when it can be said of him+"Der schwere Panzer wird zum Fluegelkleide+Kurz ist der Schmerz, unendlich ist die Freude."++THE EMPTINESS OF EXISTENCE.++This emptiness finds its expression in the whole form of existence, inthe infiniteness of Time and Space as opposed to the finiteness of the+individual in both; in the flitting present as the only manner of realexistence; in the dependence and relativity of all things; in constantly+Becoming without Being; in continually wishing without being satisfied;in an incessant thwarting of one's efforts, which go to make up life,+until victory is won. _Time_, and the _transitoriness_ of all things,are merely the form under which the will to live, which as the+thing-in-itself is imperishable, has revealed to Time the futility ofits efforts. Time is that by which at every moment all things become as+nothing in our hands, and thereby lose all their true value.+* * * * *+What _has been_ exists no more; and exists just as little as that whichhas _never_ been. But everything that exists _has been_ in the next+moment. Hence something belonging to the present, however unimportant itmay be, is superior to something important belonging to the past; this+is because the former is a _reality_ and related to the latter assomething is to nothing.+A man to his astonishment all at once becomes conscious of existing+after having been in a state of non-existence for many thousands ofyears, when, presently again, he returns to a state of non-existence for+an equally long time. This cannot possibly be true, says the heart; andeven the crude mind, after giving the matter its consideration, must+have some sort of presentiment of the ideality of time. This ideality oftime, together with that of space, is the key to every true system of+metaphysics, because it finds room for quite another order of thingsthan is to be found in nature. This is why Kant is so great.+Of every event in our life it is only for a moment that we can say that+it _is_; after that we must say for ever that it _was_. Every eveningmakes us poorer by a day. It would probably make us angry to see this+short space of time slipping away, if we were not secretly conscious inthe furthest depths of our being that the spring of eternity belongs to+us, and that in it we are always able to have life renewed.+Reflections of the nature of those above may, indeed, establish thebelief that to enjoy the present, and to make this the purpose of one's+life, is the greatest _wisdom_; since it is the present alone that isreal, everything else being only the play of thought. But such a purpose+might just as well be called the greatest _folly_, for that which in thenext moment exists no more, and vanishes as completely as a dream, can+never be worth a serious effort.+* * * * *+Our existence is based solely on the ever-fleeting present. Essentially,therefore, it has to take the form of continual motion without there+ever being any possibility of our finding the rest after which we arealways striving. It is the same as a man running downhill, who falls if+he tries to stop, and it is only by his continuing to run on that hekeeps on his legs; it is like a pole balanced on one's finger-tips, or+like a planet that would fall into its sun as soon as it stoppedhurrying onwards. Hence unrest is the type of existence.+In a world like this, where there is no kind of stability, no+possibility of anything lasting, but where everything is thrown into arestless whirlpool of change, where everything hurries on, flies, and is+maintained in the balance by a continual advancing and moving, it isimpossible to imagine happiness. It cannot dwell where, as Plato says,+_continual Becoming and never Being_ is all that takes place. First ofall, no man is happy; he strives his whole life long after imaginary+happiness, which he seldom attains, and if he does, then it is only tobe disillusioned; and as a rule he is shipwrecked in the end and enters+the harbour dismasted. Then it is all the same whether he has been happyor unhappy in a life which was made up of a merely ever-changing present+and is now at an end.+Meanwhile it surprises one to find, both in the world of human beingsand in that of animals, that this great, manifold, and restless motion+is sustained and kept going by the medium of two simple impulses--hungerand the instinct of sex, helped perhaps a little by boredom--and that+these have the power to form the _primum mobile_ of so complex amachinery, setting in motion the variegated show!+Looking at the matter a little closer, we see at the very outset that+the existence of inorganic matter is being constantly attacked bychemical forces which eventually annihilates it. While organic existence+is only made possible by continual change of matter, to keep up aperpetual supply of which it must consequently have help from without.+Therefore organic life is like balancing a pole on one's hand; it mustbe kept in continual motion, and have a constant supply of matter of+which it is continually and endlessly in need. Nevertheless it is onlyby means of this organic life that consciousness is possible.+Accordingly this is a _finite existence_, and its antithesis would be an+_infinite_, neither exposed to any attack from without nor in want ofhelp from without, and hence [Greek: aei hosautos on], in eternal rest;+[Greek: oute gignomenon, oute apollymenon], without change, withouttime, and without diversity; the negative knowledge of which is the+fundamental note of Plato's philosophy. The denial of the will to livereveals the way to such a state as this.+* * * * *+The scenes of our life are like pictures in rough mosaic, which have no+effect at close quarters, but must be looked at from a distance in orderto discern their beauty. So that to obtain something we have desired is+to find out that it is worthless; we are always living in expectation ofbetter things, while, at the same time, we often repent and long for+things that belong to the past. We accept the present as something thatis only temporary, and regard it only as a means to accomplish our aim.+So that most people will find if they look back when their life is at anend, that they have lived their lifelong _ad interim_, and they will be+surprised to find that something they allowed to pass by unnoticed andunenjoyed was just their life--that is to say, it was the very thing in+the expectation of which they lived. And so it may be said of man ingeneral that, befooled by hope, he dances into the arms of death.+Then again, there is the insatiability of each individual will; every+time it is satisfied a new wish is engendered, and there is no end toits eternally insatiable desires.+This is because the Will, taken in itself, is the lord of worlds; since+everything belongs to it, it is not satisfied with a portion ofanything, but only with the whole, which, however, is endless. Meanwhile+it must excite our pity when we consider how extremely little this lordof the world receives, when it makes its appearance as an individual;+for the most part only just enough to maintain the body. This is why manis so very unhappy.+In the present age, which is intellectually impotent and remarkable for+its veneration of what is bad in every form--a condition of things whichis quite in keeping with the coined word "Jetztzeit" (present time), as+pretentious as it is cacophonic--the pantheists make bold to say thatlife is, as they call it, "an end-in itself." If our existence in this+world were an end-in-itself, it would be the most absurd end that wasever determined; even we ourselves or any one else might have imagined+it.+Life presents itself next as a task, the task, that is, of subsisting_de gagner sa vie_. If this is solved, then that which has been won+becomes a burden, and involves the second task of its being got rid ofin order to ward off boredom, which, like a bird of prey, is ready to+fall upon any life that is secure from want.+So that the first task is to win something, and the second, after thesomething has been won, to forget about it, otherwise it becomes a+burden.+That human life must be a kind of mistake is sufficiently clear from thefact that man is a compound of needs, which are difficult to satisfy;+moreover, if they are satisfied, all he is granted is a state ofpainlessness, in which he can only give himself up to boredom. This is a+precise proof that existence in itself has no value, since boredom ismerely the feeling of the emptiness of life. If, for instance, life, the+longing for which constitutes our very being, had in itself any positiveand real value, boredom could not exist; mere existence in itself would+supply us with everything, and therefore satisfy us. But our existencewould not be a joyous thing unless we were striving after something;+distance and obstacles to be overcome then represent our aim assomething that would satisfy us--an illusion which vanishes when our aim+has been attained; or when we are engaged in something that is of apurely intellectual nature, when, in reality, we have retired from the+world, so that we may observe it from the outside, like spectators at atheatre. Even sensual pleasure itself is nothing but a continual+striving, which ceases directly its aim is attained. As soon as we arenot engaged in one of these two ways, but thrown back on existence+itself, we are convinced of the emptiness and worthlessness of it; andthis it is we call boredom. That innate and ineradicable craving for+what is out of the common proves how glad we are to have the natural andtedious course of things interrupted. Even the pomp and splendour of the+rich in their stately castles is at bottom nothing but a futile attemptto escape the very essence of existence, _misery_.+* * * * *+That the most perfect manifestation of the _will to live_, which+presents itself in the extremely subtle and complicated machinery of thehuman organism, must fall to dust and finally deliver up its whole being+to dissolution, is the naive way in which Nature, invariably true andgenuine, declares the whole striving of the will in its very essence to+be of no avail. If it were of any value in itself, somethingunconditioned, its end would not be non-existence. This is the dominant+note of Goethe's beautiful song:+"Hoch auf dem alten Thurme stehtDes Helden edler Geist."+That man is nothing but a phenomenon, that he is+not-the-thing-in-itself--I mean that he is not [Greek: ontos on]--isproved by the fact that _death is a necessity_.+And how different the beginning of our life is to the end! The former is+made up of deluded hopes, sensual enjoyment, while the latter is pursuedby bodily decay and the odour of death.+The road dividing the two, as far as our well-being and enjoyment of+life are concerned, is downhill; the dreaminess of childhood, thejoyousness of youth, the troubles of middle age, the infirmity and+frequent misery of old age, the agonies of our last illness, and finallythe struggle with death--do all these not make one feel that existence+is nothing but a mistake, the consequences of which are becominggradually more and more obvious?+It would be wisest to regard life as a _desengano_, a delusion; that+everything is intended to be so is sufficiently clear.+Our life is of a microscopical nature; it is an indivisible point which,drawn out by the powerful lenses of Time and Space, becomes considerably+magnified.+Time is an element in our brain which by the means of duration gives asemblance of reality to the _absolutely empty existence_ of things and+ourselves.+How foolish it is for a man to regret and deplore his having made no useof past opportunities, which might have secured him this or that+happiness or enjoyment! What is there left of them now? Only the ghostof a remembrance! And it is the same with everything that really falls+to our lot. So that the _form of time_ itself, and how much is reckonedon it, is a definite way of proving to us the vanity of all earthly+enjoyment.+Our existence, as well as that of all animals, is not one that lasts, itis only temporary, merely an _existentia fluxa_, which may be compared+to a water-mill in that it is constantly changing.+It is true that the _form_ of the body lasts for a time, but only oncondition that the matter is constantly changing, that the old matter is+thrown off and new added. And it is the chief work of all livingcreatures to secure a constant supply of suitable matter. At the same+time, they are conscious that their existence is so fashioned as to lastonly for a certain time, as has been said. This is why they attempt,+when they are taking leave of life, to hand it over to some one else whowill take their place. This attempt takes the form of the sexual+instinct in self-consciousness, and in the consciousness of other thingspresents itself objectively--that is, in the form of genital instinct.+This instinct may be compared to the threading of a string of pearls;one individual succeeding another as rapidly as the pearls on the+thread. If we, in imagination, hasten on this succession, we shall seethat the matter is constantly changing in the whole row just as it is+changing in each pearl, while it retains the same form: we will thenrealise that we have only a quasi-existence. That it is only Ideas which+exist, and the shadow-like nature of the thing corresponding to them, isthe basis of Plato's teachings.+That we are nothing but _phenomena_ as opposed to the thing-in-itself is+confirmed, exemplified, and made clear by the fact that the _conditiosine qua non_ of our existence is a continual flowing off and flowing to+of matter which, as nourishment, is a constant need. So that we resemblesuch phenomena as smoke, fire, or a jet of water, all of which die out+or stop directly there is no supply of matter. It may be said then thatthe _will to live_ presents itself in the form of _pure phenomena_ which+end _in nothing_. This nothingness, however, together with thephenomena, remain within the boundary of the _will to live_ and are+based on it. I admit that this is somewhat obscure.+If we try to get a general view of humanity at a glance, we shall seeeverywhere a constant fighting and mighty struggling for life and+existence; that mental and bodily strength is taxed to the utmost, andopposed by threatening and actual dangers and woes of every kind.+And if we consider the price that is paid for all this, existence, and+life itself, it will be found that there has been an interval whenexistence was free from pain, an interval, however, which was+immediately followed by boredom, and which in its turn was quicklyterminated by fresh cravings.+That boredom is immediately followed by fresh needs is a fact which is+also true of the cleverer order of animals, because life has _no trueand genuine value_ in itself, but is kept _in motion_ merely through the+medium of needs and illusion. As soon as there are no needs and illusionwe become conscious of the absolute barrenness and emptiness of+existence.+If one turns from contemplating the course of the world at large, and inparticular from the ephemeral and mock existence of men as they follow+each other in rapid succession, to the _detail_ of _life_, how like acomedy it seems!+It impresses us in the same way as a drop of water, crowded with+_infusoria_, seen through a microscope, or a little heap of cheese-mitesthat would otherwise be invisible. Their activity and struggling with+each other in such little space amuse us greatly. And it is the same inthe little span of life--great and earnest activity produces a comic+effect.+No man has ever felt perfectly happy in the present; if he had it wouldhave intoxicated him.+++ON WOMEN.+These few words of Jouy, _Sans les femmes le commencement de notre vie+seroit prive de secours, le milieu de plaisirs et la fin deconsolation_, more exactly express, in my opinion, the true praise of+woman than Schiller's poem, _Wuerde der Frauen_, which is the fruit ofmuch careful thought and impressive because of its antithesis and use of+contrast. The same thing is more pathetically expressed by Byron in_Sardanapalus_, Act i, Sc. 2:--+"The very first+Of human life must spring from woman's breast,Your first small words are taught you from her lips,+Your first tears quench'd by her, and your last sighsToo often breathed out in a woman's hearing,+When men have shrunk from the ignoble careOf watching the last hour of him who led them."+Both passages show the right point of view for the appreciation of+women.+One need only look at a woman's shape to discover that she is notintended for either too much mental or too much physical work. She pays+the debt of life not by what she does but by what she suffers--by thepains of child-bearing, care for the child, and by subjection to man, to+whom she should be a patient and cheerful companion. The greatestsorrows and joys or great exhibition of strength are not assigned to+her; her life should flow more quietly, more gently, and lessobtrusively than man's, without her being essentially happier or+unhappier.+* * * * *+Women are directly adapted to act as the nurses and educators of ourearly childhood, for the simple reason that they themselves are+childish, foolish, and short-sighted--in a word, are big children alltheir lives, something intermediate between the child and the man, who+is a man in the strict sense of the word. Consider how a young girl willtoy day after day with a child, dance with it and sing to it; and then+consider what a man, with the very best intentions in the world, coulddo in her place.+* * * * *+With girls, Nature has had in view what is called in a dramatic sense a+"striking effect," for she endows them for a few years with a richnessof beauty and a, fulness of charm at the expense of the rest of their+lives; so that they may during these years ensnare the fantasy of a manto such a degree as to make him rush into taking the honourable care of+them, in some kind of form, for a lifetime--a step which would notseem sufficiently justified if he only considered the matter.+Accordingly, Nature has furnished woman, as she has the rest of hercreatures, with the weapons and implements necessary for the protection+of her existence and for just the length of time that they will be ofservice to her; so that Nature has proceeded here with her usual+economy. Just as the female ant after coition loses her wings, whichthen become superfluous, nay, dangerous for breeding purposes, so for+the most part does a woman lose her beauty after giving birth to one ortwo children; and probably for the same reasons.+Then again we find that young girls in their hearts regard their+domestic or other affairs as secondary things, if not as a mere jest.Love, conquests, and all that these include, such as dressing, dancing,+and so on, they give their serious attention.+* * * * *+The nobler and more perfect a thing is, the later and slower is it inreaching maturity. Man reaches the maturity of his reasoning and mental+faculties scarcely before he is eight-and-twenty; woman when she iseighteen; but hers is reason of very narrow limitations. This is why+women remain children all their lives, for they always see only what isnear at hand, cling to the present, take the appearance of a thing for+reality, and prefer trifling matters to the most important. It is byvirtue of man's reasoning powers that he does not live in the present+only, like the brute, but observes and ponders over the past and future;and from this spring discretion, care, and that anxiety which we so+frequently notice in people. The advantages, as well as thedisadvantages, that this entails, make woman, in consequence of her+weaker reasoning powers, less of a partaker in them. Moreover, she isintellectually short-sighted, for although her intuitive understanding+quickly perceives what is near to her, on the other hand her circle ofvision is limited and does not embrace anything that is remote; hence+everything that is absent or past, or in the future, affects women in aless degree than men. This is why they have greater inclination for+extravagance, which sometimes borders on madness. Women in their heartsthink that men are intended to earn money so that they may spend it, if+possible during their husband's lifetime, but at any rate after hisdeath.+As soon as he has given them his earnings on which to keep house they+are strengthened in this belief. Although all this entails manydisadvantages, yet it has this advantage--that a woman lives more in the+present than a man, and that she enjoys it more keenly if it is at allbearable. This is the origin of that cheerfulness which is peculiar to+woman and makes her fit to divert man, and in case of need, to consolehim when he is weighed down by cares. To consult women in matters of+difficulty, as the Germans used to do in old times, is by no means amatter to be overlooked; for their way of grasping a thing is quite+different from ours, chiefly because they like the shortest way to thepoint, and usually keep their attention fixed upon what lies nearest;+while we, as a rule, see beyond it, for the simple reason that it liesunder our nose; it then becomes necessary for us to be brought back to+the thing in order to obtain a near and simple view. This is why womenare more sober in their judgment than we, and why they see nothing more+in things than is really there; while we, if our passions are roused,slightly exaggerate or add to our imagination.+It is because women's reasoning powers are weaker that they show more+sympathy for the unfortunate than men, and consequently take a kindlierinterest in them. On the other hand, women are inferior to men in+matters of justice, honesty, and conscientiousness. Again, because theirreasoning faculty is weak, things clearly visible and real, and+belonging to the present, exercise a power over them which is rarelycounteracted by abstract thoughts, fixed maxims, or firm resolutions, in+general, by regard for the past and future or by consideration for whatis absent and remote. Accordingly they have the first and principal+qualities of virtue, but they lack the secondary qualities which areoften a necessary instrument in developing it. Women may be compared in+this respect to an organism that has a liver but no gall-bladder.[9] Sothat it will be found that the fundamental fault in the character of+women is that they have no "_sense of justice_." This arises from theirdeficiency in the power of reasoning already referred to, and+reflection, but is also partly due to the fact that Nature has notdestined them, as the weaker sex, to be dependent on strength but on+cunning; this is why they are instinctively crafty, and have anineradicable tendency to lie. For as lions are furnished with claws and+teeth, elephants with tusks, boars with fangs, bulls with horns, and thecuttlefish with its dark, inky fluid, so Nature has provided woman for+her protection and defence with the faculty of dissimulation, and allthe power which Nature has given to man in the form of bodily strength+and reason has been conferred on woman in this form. Hence,dissimulation is innate in woman and almost as characteristic of the+very stupid as of the clever. Accordingly, it is as natural for women todissemble at every opportunity as it is for those animals to turn to+their weapons when they are attacked; and they feel in doing so that ina certain measure they are only making use of their rights. Therefore a+woman who is perfectly truthful and does not dissemble is perhaps animpossibility. This is why they see through dissimulation in others so+easily; therefore it is not advisable to attempt it with them. From thefundamental defect that has been stated, and all that it involves,+spring falseness, faithlessness, treachery, ungratefulness, and so on.In a court of justice women are more often found guilty of perjury than+men. It is indeed to be generally questioned whether they should beallowed to take an oath at all. From time to time there are repeated+cases everywhere of ladies, who want for nothing, secretly pocketing andtaking away things from shop counters.+* * * * *+Nature has made it the calling of the young, strong, and handsome men to+look after the propagation of the human race; so that the species maynot degenerate. This is the firm will of Nature, and it finds its+expression in the passions of women. This law surpasses all others inboth age and power. Woe then to the man who sets up rights and interests+in such a way as to make them stand in the way of it; for whatever hemay do or say, they will, at the first significant onset, be+unmercifully annihilated. For the secret, unformulated, nay, unconsciousbut innate moral of woman is: _We are justified in deceiving those who,+because they care a little for us_,--_that is to say for theindividual_,--_imagine they have obtained rights over the species. The+constitution, and consequently the welfare of the species, have been putinto our hands and entrusted to our care through the medium of the next+generation which proceeds from us; let us fulfil our dutiesconscientiously_.+But women are by no means conscious of this leading principle _in+abstracto_, they are only conscious of it _in concreto_, and have noother way of expressing it than in the manner in which they act when the+opportunity arrives. So that their conscience does not trouble them somuch as we imagine, for in the darkest depths of their hearts they are+conscious that in violating their duty towards the individual they haveall the better fulfilled it towards the species, whose claim upon them+is infinitely greater. (A fuller explanation of this matter may be foundin vol. ii., ch. 44, in my chief work, _Die Welt als Wille und+Vorstellung_.)+Because women in truth exist entirely for the propagation of the race,and their destiny ends here, they live more for the species than for the+individual, and in their hearts take the affairs of the species moreseriously than those of the individual. This gives to their whole being+and character a certain frivolousness, and altogether a certain tendencywhich is fundamentally different from that of man; and this it is which+develops that discord in married life which is so prevalent and almostthe normal state.+It is natural for a feeling of mere indifference to exist between men,+but between women it is actual enmity. This is due perhaps to the factthat _odium figulinum_ in the case of men, is limited to their everyday+affairs, but with women embraces the whole sex; since they have only onekind of business. Even when they meet in the street, they look at each+other like Guelphs and Ghibellines. And it is quite evident when twowomen first make each other's acquaintance that they exhibit more+constraint and dissimulation than two men placed in similarcircumstances. This is why an exchange of compliments between two women+is much more ridiculous than between two men. Further, while a man will,as a rule, address others, even those inferior to himself, with a+certain feeling of consideration and humanity, it is unbearable to seehow proudly and disdainfully a lady of rank will, for the most part,+behave towards one who is in a lower rank (not employed in her service)when she speaks to her. This may be because differences of rank are much+more precarious with women than with us, and consequently more quicklychange their line of conduct and elevate them, or because while a+hundred things must be weighed in our case, there is only one to beweighed in theirs, namely, with which man they have found favour; and+again, because of the one-sided nature of their vocation they stand incloser relationship to each other than men do; and so it is they try to+render prominent the differences of rank.+* * * * *+It is only the man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual instinctthat could give that stunted, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and+short-legged race the name of _the fair sex_; for the entire beauty ofthe sex is based on this instinct. One would be more justified in+calling them the _unaesthetic sex_ than the beautiful. Neither formusic, nor for poetry, nor for fine art have they any real or true sense+and susceptibility, and it is mere mockery on their part, in theirdesire to please, if they affect any such thing.+This makes them incapable of taking a purely objective interest in+anything, and the reason for it is, I fancy, as follows. A man strivesto get _direct_ mastery over things either by understanding them or by+compulsion. But a woman is always and everywhere driven to _indirect_mastery, namely through a man; all her _direct_ mastery being limited to+him alone. Therefore it lies in woman's nature to look upon everythingonly as a means for winning man, and her interest in anything else is+always a simulated one, a mere roundabout way to gain her ends,consisting of coquetry and pretence. Hence Rousseau said, _Les femmes,+en general, n'aiment aucun art, ne se connoissent a aucun et n'ont aucungenie_ (Lettre a d'Alembert, note xx.). Every one who can see through a+sham must have found this to be the case. One need only watch the waythey behave at a concert, the opera, or the play; the childish+simplicity, for instance, with which they keep on chattering during thefinest passages in the greatest masterpieces. If it is true that the+Greeks forbade women to go to the play, they acted in a right way; forthey would at any rate be able to hear something. In our day it would be+more appropriate to substitute _taceat mulier in theatro_ for _taceatmulier in ecclesia_; and this might perhaps be put up in big letters on+the curtain.+Nothing different can be expected of women if it is borne in mind thatthe most eminent of the whole sex have never accomplished anything in+the fine arts that is really great, genuine, and original, or given tothe world any kind of work of permanent value. This is most striking in+regard to painting, the technique of which is as much within their reachas within ours; this is why they pursue it so industriously. Still, they+have not a single great painting to show, for the simple reason thatthey lack that objectivity of mind which is precisely what is so+directly necessary in painting. They always stick to what is subjective.For this reason, ordinary women have no susceptibility for painting at+all: for _natura non facet saltum_. And Huarte, in his book which hasbeen famous for three hundred years, _Examen de ingenios para las+scienzias_, contends that women do not possess the higher capacities.Individual and partial exceptions do not alter the matter; women are and+remain, taken altogether, the most thorough and incurable philistines;and because of the extremely absurd arrangement which allows them to+share the position and title of their husbands they are a constantstimulus to his _ignoble_ ambitions. And further, it is because they are+philistines that modern society, to which they give the tone and wherethey have sway, has become corrupted. As regards their position, one+should be guided by Napoleon's maxim, _Les femmes n'ont pas de rang_;and regarding them in other things, Chamfort says very truly: _Elles+sont faites pour commercer avec nos faiblesses avec notre folie, maisnon avec notre raison. Il existe entre elles et les hommes des+sympathies d'epiderme et tres-peu de sympathies d'esprit d'ame et decaractere_. They are the _sexus sequior_, the second sex in every+respect, therefore their weaknesses should be spared, but to treat womenwith extreme reverence is ridiculous, and lowers us in their own eyes.+When nature divided the human race into two parts, she did not cut itexactly through the middle! The difference between the positive and+negative poles, according to polarity, is not merely qualitative butalso quantitative. And it was in this light that the ancients and people+of the East regarded woman; they recognised her true position betterthan we, with our old French ideas of gallantry and absurd veneration,+that highest product of Christian-Teutonic stupidity. These ideas haveonly served to make them arrogant and imperious, to such an extent as to+remind one at times of the holy apes in Benares, who, in theconsciousness of their holiness and inviolability, think they can do+anything and everything they please.+In the West, the woman, that is to say the "lady," finds herself in a_fausse position_; for woman, rightly named by the ancients _sexus+sequior_, is by no means fit to be the object of our honour andveneration, or to hold her head higher than man and to have the same+rights as he. The consequences of this _fausse position_ aresufficiently clear. Accordingly, it would be a very desirable thing if+this Number Two of the human race in Europe were assigned her naturalposition, and the lady-grievance got rid of, which is not only ridiculed+by the whole of Asia, but would have been equally ridiculed by Greeceand Rome. The result of this would be that the condition of our social,+civil, and political affairs would be incalculably improved. The Saliclaw would be unnecessary; it would be a superfluous truism. The European+lady, strictly speaking, is a creature who should not exist at all; butthere ought to be housekeepers, and young girls who hope to become such;+and they should be brought up not to be arrogant, but to be domesticatedand submissive. It is exactly because there are _ladies_ in Europe that+women of a lower standing, that is to say, the greater majority of thesex, are much more unhappy than they are in the East. Even Lord Byron+says (_Letters and Papers_, by Thomas Moore, vol. ii. p. 399), _Thoughtof the state of women under the ancient Greeks--convenient enough.+Present state, a remnant of the barbarism of the chivalric and feudalages--artificial and unnatural. They ought to mind home--and be well fed+and clothed--but not mixed in society. Well educated, too, inreligion--but to read neither poetry nor politics--nothing but books of+piety and cookery. Music--drawing--dancing--also a little gardening andploughing now and then. I have seen them mending the roads in Epirus+with good success. Why not, as well as hay-making and milking_?+* * * * *+In our part of the world, where monogamy is in force, to marry means tohalve one's rights and to double one's duties. When the laws granted+woman the same rights as man, they should also have given her amasculine power of reason. On the contrary, just as the privileges and+honours which the laws decree to women surpass what Nature has meted outto them, so is there a proportional decrease in the number of women who+really share these privileges; therefore the remainder are deprived oftheir natural rights in so far as the others have been given more than+Nature accords.+For the unnatural position of privilege which the institution ofmonogamy, and the laws of marriage which accompany it, assign to the+woman, whereby she is regarded throughout as a full equivalent of theman, which she is not by any means, cause intelligent and prudent men to+reflect a great deal before they make so great a sacrifice and consentto so unfair an arrangement. Therefore, whilst among polygamous nations+every woman finds maintenance, where monogamy exists the number ofmarried women is limited, and a countless number of women who are+without support remain over; those in the upper classes vegetate asuseless old maids, those in the lower are reduced to very hard work of a+distasteful nature, or become prostitutes, and lead a life which is asjoyless as it is void of honour. But under such circumstances they+become a necessity to the masculine sex; so that their position isopenly recognised as a special means for protecting from seduction those+other women favoured by fate either to have found husbands, or who hopeto find them. In London alone there are 80,000 prostitutes. Then what+are these women who have come too quickly to this most terrible end buthuman sacrifices on the altar of monogamy? The women here referred to+and who are placed in this wretched position are the inevitablecounterbalance to the European lady, with her pretensions and arrogance.+Hence polygamy is a real benefit to the female sex, taking it _as awhole_. And, on the other hand, there is no reason why a man whose wife+suffers from chronic illness, or remains barren, or has gradually becometoo old for him, should not take a second. Many people become converts+to Mormonism for the precise reasons that they condemn the unnaturalinstitution of monogamy. The conferring of unnatural rights upon women+has imposed unnatural duties upon them, the violation of which, however,makes them unhappy. For example, many a man thinks marriage unadvisable+as far as his social standing and monetary position are concerned,unless he contracts a brilliant match. He will then wish to win a woman+of his own choice under different conditions, namely, under those whichwill render safe her future and that of her children. Be the conditions+ever so just, reasonable, and adequate, and she consents by giving upthose undue privileges which marriage, as the basis of civil society,+alone can bestow, she must to a certain extent lose her honour and leada life of loneliness; since human nature makes us dependent on the+opinion of others in a way that is completely out of proportion to itsvalue. While, if the woman does not consent, she runs the risk of being+compelled to marry a man she dislikes, or of shrivelling up into an oldmaid; for the time allotted to her to find a home is very short. In view+of this side of the institution of monogamy, Thomasius's profoundlylearned treatise, _de Concubinatu_, is well worth reading, for it shows+that, among all nations, and in all ages, down to the LutheranReformation, concubinage was allowed, nay, that it was an institution,+in a certain measure even recognised by law and associated with nodishonour. And it held this position until the Lutheran Reformation,+when it was recognised as another means for justifying the marriage ofthe clergy; whereupon the Catholic party did not dare to remain+behindhand in the matter.+It is useless to argue about polygamy, it must be taken as a factexisting everywhere, the _mere regulation_ of which is the problem to be+solved. Where are there, then, any real monogamists? We all live, at anyrate for a time, and the majority of us always, in polygamy.+Consequently, as each man needs many women, nothing is more just than tolet him, nay, make it incumbent upon him to provide for many women. By+this means woman will be brought back to her proper and natural place asa subordinate being, and _the lady_, that monster of European+civilisation and Christian-Teutonic stupidity, with her ridiculous claimto respect and veneration, will no longer exist; there will still be+_women_, but no _unhappy women_, of whom Europe is at present full. TheMormons' standpoint is right.+* * * * *+In India no woman is ever independent, but each one stands under the+control of her father or her husband, or brother or son, in accordancewith the law of Manu.+It is certainly a revolting idea that widows should sacrifice themselves+on their husband's dead body; but it is also revolting that the moneywhich the husband has earned by working diligently for all his life, in+the hope that he was working for his children, should be wasted on herparamours. _Medium tenuere beati_. The first love of a mother, as that+of animals and men, is purely _instinctive_, and consequently ceaseswhen the child is no longer physically helpless. After that, the first+love should be reinstated by a love based on habit and reason; but thisoften does not appear, especially where the mother has not loved the+father. The love of a father for his children is of a different natureand more sincere; it is founded on a recognition of his own inner self+in the child, and is therefore metaphysical in its origin.+In almost every nation, both of the new and old world, and even amongthe Hottentots, property is inherited by the male descendants alone; it+is only in Europe that one has departed from this. That the propertywhich men have with difficulty acquired by long-continued struggling and+hard work should afterwards come into the hands of women, who, in theirwant of reason, either squander it within a short time or otherwise+waste it, is an injustice as great as it is common, and it should beprevented by limiting the right of women to inherit. It seems to me that+it would be a better arrangement if women, be they widows or daughters,only inherited the money for life secured by mortgage, but not the+property itself or the capital, unless there lacked male descendants. Itis men who make the money, and not women; therefore women are neither+justified in having unconditional possession of it nor capable ofadministrating it. Women should never have the free disposition of+wealth, strictly so-called, which they may inherit, such as capital,houses, and estates. They need a guardian always; therefore they should+not have the guardianship of their children under any circumstanceswhatever. The vanity of women, even if it should not be greater than+that of men, has this evil in it, that it is directed on materialthings--that is to say, on their personal beauty and then on tinsel,+pomp, and show. This is why they are in their right element in society.This it is which makes them inclined to be _extravagant_, especially+since they possess little reasoning power. Accordingly, an ancientwriter says, [Greek: Gunae to synolon esti dapanaeron physei].[10] Men's+vanity, on the other hand, is often directed on non-material advantages,such as intellect, learning, courage, and the like. Aristotle explains+in the _Politics_[11] the great disadvantages which the Spartans broughtupon themselves by granting too much to their women, by allowing them+the right of inheritance and dowry, and a great amount of freedom; andhow this contributed greatly to the fall of Sparta. May it not be that+the influence of women in France, which has been increasing since LouisXIII.'s time, was to blame for that gradual corruption of the court and+government which led to the first Revolution, of which all subsequentdisturbances have been the result? In any case, the false position of+the female sex, so conspicuously exposed by the existence of the "lady,"is a fundamental defect in our social condition, and this defect,+proceeding from the very heart of it, must extend its harmful influencein every direction. That woman is by nature intended to obey is shown by+the fact that every woman who is placed in the unnatural position ofabsolute independence at once attaches herself to some kind of man, by+whom she is controlled and governed; this is because she requires amaster. If she, is young, the man is a lover; if she is old, a priest.+FOOTNOTES:+[9] Let me refer to what I have said in my treatise on _The Foundation+of Morals_, Sec.71.+[10] Brunck's _Gnomici poetae graeci_ v. 115.+[11] Bk. I., ch. 9.++THINKING FOR ONESELF.++The largest library in disorder is not so useful as a smaller butorderly one; in the same way the greatest amount of knowledge, if it has+not been worked out in one's own mind, is of less value than a muchsmaller amount that has been fully considered. For it is only when a man+combines what he knows from all sides, and compares one truth withanother, that he completely realises his own knowledge and gets it into+his power. A man can only think over what he knows, therefore he shouldlearn something; but a man only knows what he has pondered.+A man can apply himself of his own free will to reading and learning,+while he cannot to thinking. Thinking must be kindled like a fire by adraught and sustained by some kind of interest in the subject. This+interest may be either of a purely objective nature or it may be merelysubjective. The latter exists in matters concerning us personally, but+objective interest is only to be found in heads that think by nature,and to whom thinking is as natural as breathing; but they are very rare.+This is why there is so little of it in most men of learning.+The difference between the effect that thinking for oneself and thatreading has on the mind is incredibly great; hence it is continually+developing that original difference in minds which induces one man tothink and another to read. Reading forces thoughts upon the mind which+are as foreign and heterogeneous to the bent and mood in which it may befor the moment, as the seal is to the wax on which it stamps its+imprint. The mind thus suffers total compulsion from without; it hasfirst this and first that to think about, for which it has at the time+neither instinct nor liking.+On the other hand, when a man thinks for himself he follows his ownimpulse, which either his external surroundings or some kind of+recollection has determined at the moment. His visible surroundings donot leave upon his mind _one_ single definite thought as reading does,+but merely supply him with material and occasion to think over what isin keeping with his nature and present mood. This is why _much_ reading+robs the mind of all elasticity; it is like keeping a spring under acontinuous, heavy weight. If a man does not want to think, the safest+plan is to take up a book directly he has a spare moment.+This practice accounts for the fact that learning makes most men morestupid and foolish than they are by nature, and prevents their writings+from being a success; they remain, as Pope has said,+"For ever reading, never to be read."--_Dunciad_ iii. 194.+Men of learning are those who have read the contents of books. Thinkers,geniuses, and those who have enlightened the world and furthered the+race of men, are those who have made direct use of the book of theworld.+* * * * *+Indeed, it is only a man's own fundamental thoughts that have truth and+life in them. For it is these that he really and completely understands.To read the thoughts of others is like taking the remains of some one+else's meal, like putting on the discarded clothes of a stranger.+The thought we read is related to the thought which rises in us, as thefossilised impress of a prehistoric plant is to a plant budding out in+spring.+* * * * *+Reading is merely a substitute for one's own thoughts. A man allows histhoughts to be put into leading-strings.+Further, many books serve only to show how many wrong paths there are,+and how widely a man may stray if he allows himself to be led by them.But he who is guided by his genius, that is to say, he who thinks for+himself, who thinks voluntarily and rightly, possesses the compasswherewith to find the right course. A man, therefore, should only read+when the source of his own thoughts stagnates; which is often the casewith the best of minds.+It is sin against the Holy Spirit to frighten away one's own original+thoughts by taking up a book. It is the same as a man flying from Natureto look at a museum of dried plants, or to study a beautiful landscape+in copperplate. A man at times arrives at a truth or an idea afterspending much time in thinking it out for himself, linking together his+various thoughts, when he might have found the same thing in a book; itis a hundred times more valuable if he has acquired it by thinking it+out for himself. For it is only by his thinking it out for himself thatit enters as an integral part, as a living member into the whole system+of his thought, and stands in complete and firm relation with it; thatit is fundamentally understood with all its consequences, and carries+the colour, the shade, the impress of his own way of thinking; and comesat the very moment, just as the necessity for it is felt, and stands+fast and cannot be forgotten. This is the perfect application, nay,interpretation of Goethe's+"Was du ererbt von deinen Vaetern hast+Erwirb es um es zu besitzen."+The man who thinks for himself learns the authorities for his opinionsonly later on, when they serve merely to strengthen both them and+himself; while the book-philosopher starts from the authorities andother people's opinions, therefrom constructing a whole for himself; so+that he resembles an automaton, whose composition we do not understand.The other man, the man who thinks for himself, on the other hand, is+like a living man as made by nature. His mind is impregnated fromwithout, which then bears and brings forth its child. Truth that has+been merely learned adheres to us like an artificial limb, a falsetooth, a waxen nose, or at best like one made out of another's flesh;+truth which is acquired by thinking for oneself is like a naturalmember: it alone really belongs to us. Here we touch upon the difference+between the thinking man and the mere man of learning. Therefore theintellectual acquirements of the man who thinks for himself are like a+fine painting that stands out full of life, that has its light and shadecorrect, the tone sustained, and perfect harmony of colour. The+intellectual attainments of the merely learned man, on the contrary,resemble a big palette covered with every colour, at most systematically+arranged, but without harmony, relation, and meaning.+* * * * *+_Reading_ is thinking with some one else's head instead of one's own.But to think for oneself is to endeavour to develop a coherent whole, a+system, even if it is not a strictly complete one. Nothing is moreharmful than, by dint of continual reading, to strengthen the current of+other people's thoughts. These thoughts, springing from different minds,belonging to different systems, bearing different colours, never flow+together of themselves into a unity of thought, knowledge, insight, orconviction, but rather cram the head with a Babylonian confusion of+tongues; consequently the mind becomes overcharged with them and isdeprived of all clear insight and almost disorganised. This condition of+things may often be discerned in many men of learning, and it makes theminferior in sound understanding, correct judgment, and practical tact to+many illiterate men, who, by the aid of experience, conversation, and alittle reading, have acquired a little knowledge from without, and made+it always subordinate to and incorporated it with their own thoughts.+The scientific _thinker_ also does this to a much greater extent.Although he requires much knowledge and must read a great deal, his mind+is nevertheless strong enough to overcome it all, to assimilate it, toincorporate it with the system of his thoughts, and to subordinate it to+the organic relative unity of his insight, which is vast andever-growing. By this means his own thought, like the bass in an organ,+always takes the lead in everything, and is never deadened by othersounds, as is the case with purely antiquarian minds; where all sorts of+musical passages, as it were, run into each other, and the fundamentaltone is entirely lost.+* * * * *+The people who have spent their lives in reading and acquired their+wisdom out of books resemble those who have acquired exact informationof a country from the descriptions of many travellers. These people can+relate a great deal about many things; but at heart they have noconnected, clear, sound knowledge of the condition of the country. While+those who have spent their life in thinking are like the people who havebeen to that country themselves; they alone really know what it is they+are saying, know the subject in its entirety, and are quite at home init.+* * * * *+The ordinary book-philosopher stands in the same relation to a man who+thinks for himself as an eye-witness does to the historian; he speaksfrom his own direct comprehension of the subject.+Therefore all who think for themselves hold at bottom much the same+views; when they differ it is because they hold different points ofview, but when these do not alter the matter they all say the same+thing. They merely express what they have grasped from an objectivepoint of view. I have frequently hesitated to give passages to the+public because of their paradoxical nature, and afterwards to my joyfulsurprise have found the same thoughts expressed in the works of great+men of long ago.+The book-philosopher, on the other hand, relates what one man has saidand another man meant, and what a third has objected to, and so on. He+compares, weighs, criticises, and endeavours to get at the truth of thething, and in this way resembles the critical historian. For instance,+he will try to find out whether Leibnitz was not for some time in hislife a follower of Spinoza, etc. The curious student will find striking+examples of what I mean in Herbart's _Analytical Elucidation of Moralityand Natural Right_, and in his _Letters on Freedom_. It surprises us+that such a man should give himself so much trouble; for it is evidentthat if he had fixed his attention on the matter he would soon have+attained his object by thinking a little for himself.+But there is a small difficulty to overcome; a thing of this kind doesnot depend upon our own will. One can sit down at any time and read, but+not--think. It is with thoughts as with men: we cannot always summonthem at pleasure, but must wait until they come. Thought about a subject+must come of its own accord by a happy and harmonious union of externalmotive with mental temper and application; and it is precisely that+which never seems to come to these people.+One has an illustration of this in matters that concern our personalinterest. If we have to come to a decision on a thing of this kind we+cannot sit down at any particular moment and thrash out the reasons andarrive at a decision; for often at such a time our thoughts cannot be+fixed, but will wander off to other things; a dislike to the subject issometimes responsible for this. We should not use force, but wait until+the mood appears of itself; it frequently comes unexpectedly and evenrepeats itself; the different moods which possess us at the different+times throwing another light on the matter. It is this long processwhich is understood by _a ripe resolution_. For the task of making up+our mind must be distributed; much that has been previously overlookedoccurs to us; the aversion also disappears, for, after examining the+matter closer, it seems much more tolerable than it was at first sight.+And in theory it is just the same: a man must wait for the right moment;even the greatest mind is not always able to think for itself at all+times. Therefore it is advisable for it to use its spare moments inreading, which, as has been said, is a substitute for one's own thought;+in this way material is imported to the mind by letting another thinkfor us, although it is always in a way which is different from our own.+For this reason a man should not read too much, in order that his minddoes not become accustomed to the substitute, and consequently even+forget the matter in question; that it may not get used to walking inpaths that have already been trodden, and by following a foreign course+of thought forget its own. Least of all should a man for the sake ofreading entirely withdraw his attention from the real world: as the+impulse and temper which lead one to think for oneself proceed oftenerfrom it than from reading; for it is the visible and real world in its+primitiveness and strength that is the natural subject of the thinkingmind, and is able more easily than anything else to rouse it. After+these considerations it will not surprise us to find that the thinkingman can easily be distinguished from the book-philosopher by his marked+earnestness, directness, and originality, the personal conviction of allhis thoughts and expressions: the book-philosopher, on the other hand,+has everything second-hand; his ideas are like a collection of old ragsobtained anyhow; he is dull and pointless, resembling a copy of a copy.+His style, which is full of conventional, nay, vulgar phrases andcurrent terms, resembles a small state where there is a circulation of+foreign money because it coins none of its own.+* * * * *+Mere experience can as little as reading take the place of thought. Mereempiricism bears the same relation to thinking as eating to digestion+and assimilation. When experience boasts that it alone, by itsdiscoveries, has advanced human knowledge, it is as though the mouth+boasted that it was its work alone to maintain the body.+The works of all really capable minds are distinguished from all otherworks by a character of decision and definiteness, and, in consequence,+of lucidity and clearness. This is because minds like these knowdefinitely and clearly what they wish to express--whether it be in+prose, in verse, or in music. Other minds are wanting in this decisionand clearness, and therefore may be instantly recognised.+The characteristic sign of a mind of the highest standard is the+directness of its judgment. Everything it utters is the result ofthinking for itself; this is shown everywhere in the way it gives+expression to its thoughts. Therefore it is, like a prince, an imperialdirector in the realm of intellect. All other minds are mere delegates,+as may be seen by their style, which has no stamp of its own.+Hence every true thinker for himself is so far like a monarch; he isabsolute, and recognises nobody above him. His judgments, like the+decrees of a monarch, spring from his own sovereign power and proceeddirectly from himself. He takes as little notice of authority as a+monarch does of a command; nothing is valid unless he has himselfauthorised it. On the other hand, those of vulgar minds, who are swayed+by all kinds of current opinions, authorities, and prejudices, are likethe people which in silence obey the law and commands.+* * * * *+The people who are so eager and impatient to settle disputed questions,+by bringing forward authorities, are really glad when they can place theunderstanding and insight of some one else in the field in place of+their own, which are deficient. Their number is legion. For, as Senecasays, "_Unusquisque mavult credere, quam judicare._"+The weapon they commonly use in their controversies is that of+authorities: they strike each other with it, and whoever is drawn intothe fray will do well not to defend himself with reason and arguments;+for against a weapon of this kind they are like horned Siegfrieds,immersed in a flood of incapacity for thinking and judging. They will+bring forward their authorities as an _argumentum ad verecundiam_ andthen cry _victoria_.+* * * * *+In the realm of reality, however fair, happy, and pleasant it may prove+to be, we always move controlled by the law of gravity, which we must beunceasingly overcoming. While in the realm of thought we are disembodied+spirits, uncontrolled by the law of gravity and free from penury.+This is why there is no happiness on earth like that which at thepropitious moment a fine and fruitful mind finds in itself.+* * * * *+The presence of a thought is like the presence of our beloved. We+imagine we shall never forget this thought, and that this loved onecould never be indifferent to us. But out of sight out of mind! The+finest thought runs the risk of being irrevocably forgotten if it is notwritten down, and the dear one of being forsaken if we do not marry her.+* * * * *+There are many thoughts which are valuable to the man who thinks them;+but out of them only a few which possess strength to produce eitherrepercussion or reflex action, that is, to win the reader's sympathy+after they have been written down. It is what a man has thought outdirectly _for himself_ that alone has true value. Thinkers may be+classed as follows: those who, in the first place, think for themselves,and those who think directly for others. The former thinkers are the+genuine, _they think for themselves_ in both senses of the word; theyare the true _philosophers_; they alone are in earnest. Moreover, the+enjoyment and happiness of their existence consist in thinking. Theothers are the _sophists_; they wish to _seem_, and seek their happiness+in what they hope to get from other people; their earnestness consistsin this. To which of these two classes a man belongs is soon seen by his+whole method and manner. Lichtenberg is an example of the first class,while Herder obviously belongs to the second.+* * * * *+When one considers how great and how close to us the _problem of+existence_ is,--this equivocal, tormented, fleeting, dream-likeexistence--so great and so close that as soon as one perceives it, it+overshadows and conceals all other problems and aims;--and when one seeshow all men--with a few and rare exceptions--are not clearly conscious+of the problem, nay, do not even seem to see it, but trouble themselvesabout everything else rather than this, and live on taking thought only+for the present day and the scarcely longer span of their own personalfuture, while they either expressly give the problem up or are ready to+agree with it, by the aid of some system of popular metaphysics, and aresatisfied with this;--when one, I say, reflects upon this, so may one be+of the opinion that man is a _thinking being_ only in a very remotesense, and not feel any special surprise at any trait of thoughtlessness+or folly; but know, rather, that the intellectual outlook of the normalman indeed surpasses that of the brute,--whose whole existence resembles+a continual present without any consciousness of the future or thepast--but, however, not to such an extent as one is wont to suppose.+And corresponding to this, we find in the conversation of most men that+their thoughts are cut up as small as chaff, making it impossible forthem to spin out the thread of their discourse to any length. If this+world were peopled by really thinking beings, noise of every kind wouldnot be so universally tolerated, as indeed the most horrible and aimless+form of it is.[12] If Nature had intended man to think she would nothave given him ears, or, at any rate, she would have furnished them with+air-tight flaps like the bat, which for this reason is to be envied.But, in truth, man is like the rest, a poor animal, whose powers are+calculated only to maintain him during his existence; therefore herequires to have his ears always open to announce of themselves, by+night as by day, the approach of the pursuer.+FOOTNOTES:+[12] See Essay on Noise, p. 28.++SHORT DIALOGUE ON+THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF OUR TRUE BEING BY DEATH.++_Thrasymachos._ Tell me briefly, what shall I be after my death? Beclear and precise.+_Philalethes._ Everything and nothing.+_Thras._ That is what I expected. You solve the problem by a+contradiction. That trick is played out.+_Phil._ To answer transcendental questions in language that is made forimmanent knowledge must assuredly lead to a contradiction.+_Thras._ What do you call transcendental knowledge, and what immanent?+It is true these expressions are known to me, for my professor usedthem, but only as predicates of God, and as his philosophy had+exclusively to do with God, their use was quite appropriate. Forinstance, if God was in the world, He was immanent; if He was somewhere+outside it, He was transcendent. That is clear and comprehensible. Oneknows how things stand. But your old-fashioned Kantian doctrine is no+longer understood. There has been quite a succession of great men in themetropolis of German learning----+_Phil. (aside)._ German philosophical nonsense!+_Thras._----such as the eminent Schleiermacher and that gigantic mind+Hegel; and to-day we have left all that sort of thing behind, or ratherwe are so far ahead of it that it is out of date and known no more.+Therefore, what good is it?+_Phil._ Transcendental knowledge is that which, going beyond theboundary of possible experience, endeavours to determine the nature of+things as they are in themselves; while immanent knowledge keeps itselfwithin the boundary of possible experience, therefore it can only apply+to phenomena. As an individual, with your death there will be an end ofyou. But your individuality is not your true and final being, indeed it+is rather the mere expression of it; it is not the thing-in-itself butonly the phenomenon presented in the form of time, and accordingly has+both a beginning and an end. Your being in itself, on the contrary,knows neither time, nor beginning, nor end, nor the limits of a given+individuality; hence no individuality can be without it, but it is therein each and all. So that, in the first sense, after death you become+nothing; in the second, you are and remain everything. That is why Isaid that after death you would be all and nothing. It is difficult to+give you a more exact answer to your question than this and to be briefat the same time; but here we have undoubtedly another contradiction;+this is because your life is in time and your immortality in eternity.Hence your immortality may be said to be something that is+indestructible and yet has no endurance--which is again contradictory,you see. This is what happens when transcendental knowledge is brought+within the boundary of immanent knowledge; in doing this some sort ofviolence is done to the latter, since it is used for things for which it+was not intended.+_Thras._ Listen; without I retain my individuality I shall not give a_sou_ for your immortality.+_Phil._ Perhaps you will allow me to explain further. Suppose I+guarantee that you will retain your individuality, on condition,however, that you spend three months in absolute unconsciousness before+you awaken.+_Thras._ I consent to that.+_Phil._ Well then, as we have no idea of time when in a perfectlyunconscious state, it is all the same to us when we are dead whether+three months or ten thousand years pass away in the world ofconsciousness. For in the one case, as in the other, we must accept on+faith and trust what we are told when we awake. Accordingly it will beall the same to you whether your individuality is restored to you after+the lapse of three months or ten thousand years.+_Thras._ At bottom, that cannot very well be denied.+_Phil._ But if, at the end of those ten thousand years, some one hasquite forgotten to waken you, I imagine that you would have become+accustomed to that long state of non-existence, following such a veryshort existence, and that the misfortune would not be very great.+However, it is quite certain that you would know nothing about it. Andagain, it would fully console you to know that the mysterious power+which gives life to your present phenomenon had never ceased for onemoment during the ten thousand years to produce other phenomena of a+like nature and to give them life.+_Thras._ Indeed! And so it is in this way that you fancy you canquietly, and without my knowing, cheat me of my individuality? But you+cannot cozen me in this way. I have stipulated for the retaining of myindividuality, and neither mysterious forces nor phenomena can console+me for the loss of it. It is dear to me, and I shall not let it go.+_Phil._ That is to say, you regard your individuality as something sovery delightful, excellent, perfect, and incomparable that there is+nothing better than it; would you not exchange it for another, accordingto what is told us, that is better and more lasting?+_Thras._ Look here, be my individuality what it may, it is myself,+"For God is God, and I am I."+I--I--I want to exist! That is what I care about, and not an existence+which has to be reasoned out first in order to show that it is mine.+_Phil._ Look what you are doing! When you say, _I--I--I want to exist_you alone do not say this, but everything, absolutely everything, that+has only a vestige of consciousness. Consequently this desire of yoursis just that which is _not_ individual but which is common to all+without distinction. It does not proceed from individuality, but from_existence_ in general; it is the essential in everything that exists,+nay, it is _that_ whereby anything has existence at all; accordingly itis concerned and satisfied only with existence _in general_ and not with+any definite individual existence; this is not its aim. It has theappearance of being so because it can attain consciousness only in an+individual existence, and consequently looks as if it were entirelyconcerned with that. This is nothing but an illusion which has entangled+the individual; but by reflection, it can be dissipated and we ourselvesset free. It is only _indirectly_ that the individual has this great+longing for existence; it is the will to live in general that has thislonging directly and really, a longing that is one and the same in+everything. Since, then, existence itself is the free work of the will,nay, the mere reflection of it, existence cannot be apart from will, and+the latter will be provisionally satisfied with existence in general, inso far, namely, as that which is eternally dissatisfied can be+satisfied. The will is indifferent to individuality; it has nothing todo with it, although it appears to, because the individual is _only_+directly conscious of will in himself. From this it is to be gatheredthat the individual carefully guards his own existence; moreover, if+this were not so, the preservation of the species would not be assured.From all this it follows that individuality is not a state of perfection+but of limitation; so that to be freed from it is not loss but rathergain. Don't let this trouble you any further, it will, forsooth, appear+to you both childish and extremely ridiculous when you completely andthoroughly recognise what you are, namely, that your own existence is+the universal will to live.+_Thras._ You are childish yourself and extremely ridiculous, and so areall philosophers; and when a sedate man like myself lets himself in for+a quarter of an hour's talk with such fools, it is merely for the sakeof amusement and to while away the time. I have more important matters+to look to now; so, adieu!++RELIGION.+A DIALOGUE.++_Demopheles._ Between ourselves, dear old friend, I am sometimesdissatisfied with you in your capacity as philosopher; you talk+sarcastically about religion, nay, openly ridicule it. The religion ofevery one is sacred to him, and so it should be to you.+_Philalethes. Nego consequentiam!_ I don't see at all why I should have+respect for lies and frauds because other people are stupid. I respecttruth everywhere, and it is precisely for that reason that I cannot+respect anything that is opposed to it. My maxim is, _Vigeat veritas, etpereat mundus_, the same as the lawyer's _Fiat justitia, et pereat+mundus._ Every profession ought to have an analogous device.+_Demop._ Then that of the medical profession would be, _Fiant pilulae,et pereat mundus_, which would be the easiest to carry out.+_Phil._ Heaven forbid! Everything must be taken _cum grano salis_.+_Demop._ Exactly; and it is just for that reason that I want you to+accept religion _cum grano salis_, and to see that the needs of thepeople must be met according to their powers of comprehension. Religion+affords the only means of proclaiming and making the masses of crudeminds and awkward intelligences, sunk in petty pursuits and material+work, feel the high import of life. For the ordinary type of man,primarily, has no thought for anything else but what satisfies his+physical needs and longings, and accordingly affords him a littleamusement and pastime. Founders of religion and philosophers come into+the world to shake him out of his torpidity and show him the highsignificance of existence: philosophers for the few, the emancipated;+founders of religion for the many, humanity at large. For [Greek:philosophon plaethos adynaton einai], as your friend Plato has said, and+you should not forget it. Religion is the metaphysics of the people,which by all means they must keep; and hence it must be eternally+respected, for to discredit it means taking it away. Just as there ispopular poetry, popular wisdom in proverbs, so too there must be popular+metaphysics; for mankind requires most certainly _an interpretation oflife_, and it must be in keeping with its power of comprehension. So+that this interpretation is at all times an allegorical investiture ofthe truth, and it fulfils, as far as practical life and our feelings are+concerned--that is to say, as a guidance in our affairs, and as acomfort and consolation in suffering and death--perhaps just as much as+truth itself could, if we possessed it. Don't be hurt at its unpolished,baroque, and apparently absurd form, for you, with your education and+learning, cannot imagine the roundabout ways that must be used in orderto make people in their crude state understand deep truths. The various+religions are only various forms in which the people grasp andunderstand the truth, which in itself they could not grasp, and which is+inseparable from these forms. Therefore, my dear fellow, don't bedispleased if I tell you that to ridicule these forms is both+narrow-minded and unjust.+_Phil._ But is it not equally narrow-minded and unjust to require thatthere shall be no other metaphysics but this one cut out to meet the+needs and comprehension of the people? that its teachings shall be theboundary of human researches and the standard of all thought, so that+the metaphysics of the few, the emancipated, as you call them, must aimat confirming, strengthening, and interpreting the metaphysics of the+people? That is, that the highest faculties of the human mind mustremain unused and undeveloped, nay, be nipped in the bud, so that their+activity may not thwart the popular metaphysics? And at bottom are notthe claims that religion makes just the same? Is it right to have+tolerance, nay, gentle forbearance, preached by what is intolerance andcruelty itself? Let me remind you of the heretical tribunals,+inquisitions, religious wars and crusades, of Socrates' cup of poison,of Bruno's and Vanini's death in the flames. And is all this to-day+something belonging to the past? What can stand more in the way ofgenuine philosophical effort, honest inquiry after truth, the noblest+calling of the noblest of mankind, than this conventional system ofmetaphysics invested with a monopoly from the State, whose principles+are inculcated so earnestly, deeply, and firmly into every head inearliest youth as to make them, unless the mind is of miraculous+elasticity, become ineradicable? The result is that the basis of healthyreasoning is once and for all deranged--in other words, its feeble+capacity for thinking for itself, and for unbiassed judgment in regardto everything to which it might be applied, is for ever paralysed and+ruined.+_Demop,_ Which really means that the people have gained a convictionwhich they will not give up in order to accept yours in its place.+_Phil._ Ah! if it were only conviction based on insight, one would then+be able to bring forward arguments and fight the battle with equalweapons. But religions admittedly do not lend themselves to conviction+after argument has been brought to bear, but to belief as brought aboutby revelation. The capacity for belief is strongest in childhood;+therefore one is most careful to take possession of this tender age. Itis much more through this than through threats and reports of miracles+that the doctrines of belief take root. If in early childhood certainfundamental views and doctrines are preached with unusual solemnity and+in a manner of great earnestness, the like of which has never been seenbefore, and if, too, the possibility of a doubt about them is either+completely ignored or only touched upon in order to show that doubt isthe first step to everlasting perdition; the result is that the+impression will be so profound that, as a rule, that is to say in almostevery case, a man will be almost as incapable of doubting the truth of+those doctrines as he is of doubting his own existence. Hence it isscarcely one in many thousands that has the strength of mind to honestly+and seriously ask himself--is that true? Those who are able to do thishave been more appropriately styled strong minds, _esprits forts_, than+is imagined. For the commonplace mind, however, there is nothing soabsurd or revolting but what, if inoculated in this way, the firmest+belief in it will take root. If, for example, the killing of a hereticor an infidel were an essential matter for the future salvation of the+soul, almost every one would make it the principal object of his life,and in dying get consolation and strength from the remembrance of his+having succeeded; just as, in truth, in former times almost everySpaniard looked upon an _auto da fe_ as the most pious of acts and one+most pleasing to God.+We have an analogy to this in India in the _Thugs_, a religious bodyquite recently suppressed by the English, who executed numbers of them.+They showed their regard for religion and veneration for the goddessKali by assassinating at every opportunity their own friends and+fellow-travellers, so that they might obtain their possessions, and theywere seriously convinced that thereby they had accomplished something+that was praiseworthy and would contribute to their eternal welfare. Thepower of religious dogma, that has been inculcated early, is so great+that it destroys conscience, and finally all compassion and sense ofhumanity. But if you wish to see with your own eyes, and close at hand,+what early inoculation of belief does, look at the English. Look at thisnation, favoured by nature before all others, endowed before all others+with reason, intelligence, power of judgment, and firmness of character;look at these people degraded, nay, made despicable among all others by+their stupid ecclesiastical superstition, which among their othercapacities appears like a fixed idea, a monomania. For this they have to+thank the clergy in whose hands education is, and who take care toinculcate all the articles, of belief at the earliest age in such a way+as to result in a kind of partial paralysis of the brain; this thenshows itself throughout their whole life in a silly bigotry, making even+extremely intelligent and capable people among them degrade themselvesso that they become quite an enigma to us. If we consider how essential+to such a masterpiece is inoculation of belief in the tender age ofchildhood, the system of missions appears no longer merely as the height+of human importunity, arrogance, and impertinence, but also ofabsurdity; in so far as it does not confine itself to people who are+still in the stage of _childhood_, such as the Hottentots, Kaffirs,South Sea Islanders, and others like them, among whom it has been really+successful. While, on the other hand, in India the Brahmans receive thedoctrines of missionaries either with a smile of condescending approval+or refuse them with a shrug of their shoulders; and among these peoplein general, notwithstanding the most favourable circumstances, the+missionaries' attempts at conversion are usually wrecked. An authenticreport in vol. xxi. of the _Asiatic Journal_ of 1826 shows that after so+many years of missionary activity in the whole of India (of which theEnglish possessions alone amount to one hundred and fifteen million+inhabitants) there are not more than three hundred living converts to befound; and at the same time it is admitted that the Christian converts+are distinguished for their extreme immorality. There are only threehundred venal and bribed souls out of so many millions. I cannot see+that it has gone better with Christianity in India since then, althoughthe missionaries are now trying, contrary to agreement, to work on the+children's minds in schools exclusively devoted to secular Englishinstruction, in order to smuggle in Christianity, against which,+however, the Hindoos are most jealously on their guard. For, as has beensaid, childhood is the time, and not manhood, to sow the seeds of+belief, especially where an earlier belief has taken root. An acquiredconviction, however, that is assumed by matured converts serves,+generally, as only the mask for some kind of personal interest. And itis the feeling that this could hardly be otherwise that makes a man, who+changes his religion at maturity, despised by most people everywhere; afact which reveals that they do not regard religion as a matter of+reasoned conviction but merely as a belief inoculated in earlychildhood, before it has been put to any test. That they are right in+looking at religion in this way is to be gathered from the fact that itis not only the blind, credulous masses, but also the clergy of every+religion, who, as such, have studied its sources, arguments, dogmas anddifferences, who cling faithfully and zealously as a body to the+religion of their fatherland; consequently it is the rarest thing in theworld for a priest to change from one religion or creed to another. For+instance, we see that the Catholic clergy are absolutely convinced ofthe truth of all the principles of their Church, and that the+Protestants are also of theirs, and that both defend the principles oftheir confession with like zeal. And yet the conviction is the outcome+merely of the country in which each is born: the truth of the Catholicdogma is perfectly clear to the clergy of South Germany, the Protestant+to the clergy of North Germany. If, therefore, these convictions rest onobjective reasons, these reasons must be climatic and thrive like+plants, some only here, some only there. The masses everywhere, however,accept on trust and faith the convictions of those who are _locally+convinced_.+_Demop._ That doesn't matter, for essentially it makes no difference.For instance, Protestantism in reality is more suited to the north,+Catholicism to the south.+_Phil._ So it appears. Still, I take a higher point of view, and havebefore me a more important object, namely, the progress of the knowledge+of truth among the human race. It is a frightful condition of thingsthat, wherever a man is born, certain propositions are inculcated in his+earliest youth, and he is assured that under penalty of forfeitingeternal salvation he may never entertain any doubt about them; in so+far, that is, as they are propositions which influence the foundation ofall our other knowledge and accordingly decide for ever our point of+view, and if they are false, upset it for ever. Further, as theinfluences drawn from these propositions make inroads everywhere into+the entire system of our knowledge, the whole of human knowledge isthrough and through affected by them. This is proved by every+literature, and most conspicuously by that of the Middle Age, but also,in too great an extent, by that of the fifteenth and sixteenth+centuries. We see how paralysed even the minds of the first rank of allthose epochs were by such false fundamental conceptions; and how+especially all insight into the true substance and working of Nature washemmed in on every side. During the whole of the Christian period Theism+lay like a kind of oppressive nightmare on all intellectual effort, andon philosophical effort in particular, hindering and arresting all+progress. For the men of learning of those epochs, God, devil, angels,demons, hid the whole of Nature; no investigation was carried out to the+end, no matter sifted to the bottom; everything that was beyond the mostobvious _causal nexus_ was immediately attributed to these; so that, as+Pomponatius expressed himself at the time, _Certe philosophi nihilverisimile habent ad haec, quare necesse est, ad Deum, ad angelos et+daemones recurrere._ It is true that there is a suspicion of irony inwhat this man says, as his malice in other ways is known, nevertheless+he has expressed the general way of thinking of his age. If any one, onthe other hand, possessed that rare elasticity of mind which alone+enabled him to free himself from the fetters, his writings, and hehimself with them, were burnt; as happened to Bruno and Vanini. But how+absolutely paralysed the ordinary mind is by that early metaphysicalpreparation may be seen most strikingly, and from its most ridiculous+side, when it undertakes to criticise the doctrines of a foreign belief.One finds the ordinary man, as a rule, merely trying to carefully prove+that the dogmas of the foreign belief do not agree with those of hisown; he labours to explain that not only do they not say the same, but+certainly do not mean the same thing as his. With that he fancies in hissimplicity that he has proved the falsity of the doctrines of the alien+belief. It really never occurs to him to ask the question which of thetwo is right; but his own articles of belief are to him as _a priori_+certain principles. The Rev. Mr. Morrison has furnished an amusingexample of this kind in vol. xx. of the _Asiatic Journal_ wherein he+criticises the religion and philosophy of the Chinese.+_Demop._ So that's your higher point of view. But I assure you thatthere is a higher still. _Primum vivere, deinde philosophari_ is of more+comprehensive significance than one supposes at first sight. Beforeeverything else, the raw and wicked tendencies of the masses ought to be+restrained, in order to protect them from doing anything that isextremely unjust, or committing cruel, violent, and disgraceful deeds.+If one waited until they recognised and grasped the truth one wouldassuredly come too late. And supposing they had already found truth, it+would surpass their powers of comprehension. In any case it would be amere allegorical investiture of truth, a parable, or a myth that would+be of any good to them. There must be, as Kant has said, a publicstandard of right and virtue, nay, this must at all times flutter high.+It is all the same in the end what kind of heraldic figures arerepresented on it, if they only indicate what is meant. Such an+allegorical truth is at all times and everywhere, for mankind at large,a beneficial substitute for an eternally unattainable truth, and in+general, for a philosophy which it can never grasp; to say nothing ofits changing its form daily, and not having as yet attained any kind of+general recognition. Therefore practical aims, my good Philalethes, havein every way the advantage of theoretical.+_Phil._ This closely resembles the ancient advice of Timaeus of Locrus,+the Pythagorean: [Greek: tas psychas apeirgomes pseudesi logois, ei kamae agaetai alathesi].[13] And I almost suspect that it is your wish,+according to the fashion of to-day, to remind me--+"Good friend, the time is nearWhen we may feast off what is good in peace."+And your recommendation means that we should take care in time, so that+the waves of the dissatisfied, raging masses may not disturb us attable. But the whole of this point of view is as false as it is nowadays+universally liked and praised; this is why I make haste to put in aprotest against it. It is _false_ that state, justice, and law cannot be+maintained without the aid of religion and its articles of belief, andthat justice and police regulations need religion as a complement in+order to carry out legislative arrangements. It is _false_ if it wererepeated a hundred times. For the ancients, and especially the Greeks,+furnish us with striking _instantia in contrarium_ founded on fact. Theyhad absolutely nothing of what we understand by religion. They had no+sacred documents, no dogma to be learnt, and its acceptance advanced byevery one, and its principles inculcated early in youth. The servants of+religion preached just as little about morals, and the ministersconcerned themselves very little about any kind of morality or in+general about what the people either did or left undone. No such thing.But the duty of the priests was confined merely to temple ceremonies,+prayers, songs, sacrifices, processions, lustrations, and the like, allof which aimed at anything but the moral improvement of the individual.+The whole of their so-called religion consisted, and particularly in thetowns, in some of the _deorum majorum gentium_ having temples here and+there, in which the aforesaid worship was conducted as an affair ofstate, when in reality it was an affair of police. No one, except the+functionaries engaged, was obliged in any way to be present, or even tobelieve in it. In the whole of antiquity there is no trace of any+obligation to believe in any kind of dogma. It was merely any one whoopenly denied the existence of the gods or calumniated them that was+punished; because by so doing he insulted the state which served thesegods; beyond this every one was allowed to think what he chose of them.+If any one wished to win the favour of these gods privately by prayer orsacrifice he was free to do so at his own cost and risk; if he did not+do it, no one had anything to say against it, and least of all theState. Every Roman had his own Lares and Penates at home, which were,+however, at bottom nothing more than the revered portraits of hisancestors. The ancients had no kind of decisive, clear, and least of all+dogmatically fixed ideas about the immortality of the soul and a lifehereafter, but every one in his own way had lax, vacillating, and+problematical ideas; and their ideas about the gods were just asvarious, individual, and vague. So that the ancients had really no+_religion_ in our sense of the word. Was it for this reason that anarchyand lawlessness reigned among them? Is not law and civil order rather so+much their work, that it still constitutes the foundation of ours? Wasnot property perfectly secure, although it consisted of slaves for the+greater part? And did not this condition of things last longer than athousand years?+So I cannot perceive, and must protest against the practical aims and+necessity of religion in the sense which you have indicated, and in suchgeneral favour to-day, namely, as an indispensable foundation of all+legislative regulations. For from such a standpoint the pure and sacredstriving after light and truth, to say the least, would seem quixotic+and criminal if it should venture in its feeling of justice to denouncethe authoritative belief as a usurper who has taken possession of the+throne of truth and maintained it by continuing the deception.+_Demop._ But religion is not opposed to truth; for it itself teachestruth. Only it must not allow truth to appear in its naked form, because+its sphere of activity is not a narrow auditory, but the world andhumanity at large, and therefore it must conform to the requirements and+comprehension of so great and mixed a public; or, to use a medicalsimile, it must not present it pure, but must as a medium make use of a+mythical vehicle. Truth may also be compared in this respect to certainchemical stuffs which in themselves are gaseous, but which for official+uses, as also for preservation or transmission, must be bound to a firm,palpable base, because they would otherwise volatilise. For example,+chlorine is for all such purposes applied only in the form of chlorides.But if truth, pure, abstract, and free from anything of a mythical+nature, is always to remain unattainable by us all, philosophersincluded, it might be compared to fluorine, which cannot be presented by+itself alone, but only when combined with other stuffs. Or, to take asimpler simile, truth, which cannot be expressed in any other way than+by myth and allegory, is like water that cannot be transported without avessel; but philosophers, who insist upon possessing it pure, are like a+person who breaks the vessel in order to get the water by itself. Thisis perhaps a true analogy. At any rate, religion is truth allegorically+and mythically expressed, and thereby made possible and digestible tomankind at large. For mankind could by no means digest it pure and+unadulterated, just as we cannot live in pure oxygen but require anaddition of four-fifths of nitrogen. And without speaking figuratively,+the profound significance and high aim of life can only be revealed andshown to the masses symbolically, because they are not capable of+grasping life in its real sense; while philosophy should be like theEleusinian mysteries, for the few, the elect.+_Phil._ I understand. The matter resolves itself into truth putting on+the dress of falsehood. But in doing so it enters into a fatal alliance.What a dangerous weapon is given into the hands of those who have the+authority to make use of falsehood as the vehicle of truth! If such isthe case, I fear there will be more harm caused by the falsehood than+good derived from the truth. If the allegory were admitted to be such, Ishould say nothing against it; but in that case it would be deprived of+all respect, and consequently of all efficacy. Therefore the allegorymust assert a claim, which it must maintain, to be true in _sensu+proprio_ while at the most it is true in _sensu allegorico_. Here liesthe incurable mischief, the permanent evil; and therefore religion is+always in conflict, and always will be with the free and noble strivingafter pure truth.+_Demop_. Indeed, no. Care has been taken to prevent that. If religion+may not exactly admit its allegorical nature, it indicates it at anyrate sufficiently.+_Phil_. And in what way does it do that?+_Demop_. In its mysteries. _Mystery_ is at bottom only the theological+_terminus technicus_ for religious allegory. All religions have theirmysteries. In reality, a mystery is a palpably absurd dogma which+conceals in itself a lofty truth, which by itself would be absolutelyincomprehensible to the ordinary intelligence of the raw masses. The+masses accept it in this disguise on trust and faith, without allowingthemselves to be led astray by its absurdity, which is palpable to them;+and thereby they participate in the kernel of the matter so far as theyare able. I may add as an explanation that the use of mystery has been+attempted even in philosophy; for example, when Pascal, who was pietest,mathematician, and philosopher in one, says in this threefold character:+_God is everywhere centre and nowhere periphery_. Malebranche has alsotruly remarked, _La liberte est un mystere_. One might go further, and+maintain that in religions everything is really mystery. For it isutterly impossible to impart truth in _sensu proprio_ to the multitude+in its crudity; it is only a mythical and allegorical reflection of itthat can fall to its share and enlighten it. Naked truth must not appear+before the eyes of the profane vulgar; it can only appear before themclosely veiled. And it is for this reason that it is unfair to demand of+a religion that it should be true in _sensu proprio_, and that, _enpassant_. Rationalists and Supernaturalists of to-day are so absurd.+They both start with the supposition that religion must be the truth;and while the former prove that it is not, the latter obstinately+maintain that it is; or rather the former cut up and dress the allegoryin such a way that it could be true in _sensu proprio_ but would in that+case become a platitude. The latter wish to maintain, without furtherdressing, that it is true in _sensu proprio_, which, as they should+know, can only be carried into execution by inquisitions and the stake.While in reality, myth and allegory are the essential elements of+religion, but under the indispensable condition (because of theintellectual limitations of the great masses) that it supplies enough+satisfaction to meet those metaphysical needs of mankind which areineradicable, and that it takes the place of pure philosophical truth,+which is infinitely difficult, and perhaps never attainable.+_Phil._ Yes, pretty much in the same way as a wooden leg takes the placeof a natural one. It supplies what is wanting, does very poor service+for it, and claims to be regarded as a natural leg, and is more or lesscleverly put together. There is a difference, however, for, as a rule,+the natural leg was in existence before the wooden one, while religioneverywhere has gained the start of philosophy.+_Demop._ That may be; but a wooden leg is of great value to those who+have no natural leg. You must keep in view that the metaphysicalrequirements of man absolutely demand satisfaction; because the horizon+of his thoughts must be defined and not remain unlimited. A man, as arule, has no faculty of judgment for weighing reasons, and+distinguishing between what is true and what is false. Moreover, thework imposed upon him by nature and her requirements leaves him no time+for investigations of that kind, or for the education which theypresuppose. Therefore it is entirely out of the question to imagine he+will be convinced by reasons; there is nothing left for him but beliefand authority. Even if a really true philosophy took the place of+religion, at least nine-tenths of mankind would only accept it onauthority, so that it would be again a matter of belief; for Plato's+[Greek: philosophon plaethos adynaton einai] will always hold good.Authority, however, is only established by time and circumstances, so+that we cannot bestow it on that which has only reason to commend it;accordingly, we must grant it only to that which has attained it in the+course of history, even if it is only truth represented allegorically.This kind of truth, supported by authority, appeals directly to the+essentially metaphysical temperament of man--that is, to his need of atheory concerning the riddle of existence, which thrusts itself upon+him, and arises from the consciousness that behind the physical in theworld there must be a metaphysical, an unchangeable something, which+serves as the foundation of constant change. It also appeals to thewill, fears, and hopes of mortals living in constant need; religion+provides them with gods, demons, to whom they call, appease, andconciliate. Finally, it appeals to their moral consciousness, which is+undeniably present, and lends to it that authenticity and support fromwithout--a support without which it would not easily maintain itself in+the struggle against so many temptations. It is exactly from this sidethat religion provides an inexhaustible source of consolation and+comfort in the countless and great sorrows of life, a comfort which doesnot leave men in death, but rather then unfolds its full efficacy. So+that religion is like some one taking hold of the hand of a blind personand leading him, since he cannot see for himself; all that the blind+person wants is to attain his end, not to see everything as he walksalong.+_Phil._ This side is certainly the brilliant side of religion. If it is+a _fraus_ it is indeed a _pia fraus_; that cannot be denied. Thenpriests become something between deceivers and moralists. For they dare+not teach the real truth, as you yourself have quite correctlyexplained, even if it were known to them; which it is not. There can, at+any rate, be a true philosophy, but there can be no true religion: Imean true in the real and proper understanding of the word, not merely+in that flowery and allegorical sense which you have described, a sensein which every religion would be true only in different degrees. It is+certainly quite in harmony with the inextricable admixture of good andevil, honesty and dishonesty, goodness and wickedness, magnanimity and+baseness, which the world presents everywhere, that the most important,the most lofty, and the most sacred truths can make their appearance+only in combination with a lie, nay, can borrow strength from a lie assomething that affects mankind more powerfully; and as revelation must+be introduced by a lie. One might regard this fact as the _monogram_ ofthe moral world. Meanwhile let us not give up the hope that mankind will+some day attain that point of maturity and education at which it is ableto produce a true philosophy on the one hand, and accept it on the+other. _Simplex sigillum veri_: the naked truth must be so simple andcomprehensible that one can impart it to all in its true form without+any admixture of myth and fable (a pack of lies)--in other words,without masking it as _religion_.+_Demop._ You have not a sufficient idea of the wretched capacities of+the masses.+_Phil._ I express it only as a hope; but to give it up is impossible. Inthat case, if truth were in a simpler and more comprehensible form, it+would surely soon drive religion from the position of vicegerent whichit has so long held. Then religion will have fulfilled her mission and+finished her course; she might then dismiss the race which she hasguided to maturity and herself retire in peace. This will be the+_euthanasia_ of religion. However, as long as she lives she has twofaces, one of truth and one of deceit. According as one looks+attentively at one or the other one will like or dislike her. Hencereligion must be regarded as a necessary evil, its necessity resting on+the pitiful weak-mindedness of the great majority of mankind, incapableof grasping the truth, and consequently when in extremity requires a+substitute for truth.+_Demop._ Really, one would think that you philosophers had truth lyingin readiness, and all that one had to do was to lay hold of it.+_Phil._ If we have not got it, it is principally to be ascribed to the+pressure under which philosophy, at all periods and in all countries,has been held by religion. We have tried to make not only the expression+and communication of truth impossible, but even the contemplation anddiscovery of it, by giving the minds of children in earliest childhood+into the hands of priests to be worked upon; to have the groove in whichtheir fundamental thoughts are henceforth to run so firmly imprinted, as+in principal matters, to become fixed and determined for a lifetime. Iam sometimes shocked to see when I take into my hand the writings of+even the most intelligent minds of the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies, and especially if I have just left my oriental studies, how+paralysed and hemmed in on all sides they are by Jewish notions.Prepared in this way, one cannot form any idea of the true philosophy!+_Demop._ And if, moreover, this true philosophy were discovered,+religion would not cease to exist, as you imagine. There cannot be onesystem of metaphysics for everybody; the natural differences of+intellectual power in addition to those of education make thisimpossible. The great majority of mankind must necessarily be engaged in+that arduous bodily labour which is requisite in order to furnish theendless needs of the whole race. Not only does this leave the majority+no time for education, for learning, or for reflection; but by virtue ofthe strong antagonism between merely physical and intellectual+qualities, much excessive bodily labour blunts the understanding andmakes it heavy, clumsy, and awkward, and consequently incapable of+grasping any other than perfectly simple and palpable matters. At leastnine-tenths of the human race comes under this category. People require+a system of metaphysics, that is, an account of the world and ourexistence, because such an account belongs to the most natural+requirements of mankind. They require also a popular system ofmetaphysics, which, in order for it to be this, must combine many rare+qualities; for instance, it must be exceedingly lucid, and yet in theright places be obscure, nay, to a certain extent, impenetrable; then a+correct and satisfying moral system must be combined with its dogmas;above everything, it must bring inexhaustible consolation in suffering+and death. It follows from this that it can only be true in _sensuallegorico_ and not in _sensu proprio_. Further, it must have the+support of an authority which is imposing by its great age, by itsgeneral recognition, by its documents, together with their tone and+statements--qualities which are so infinitely difficult to combine thatmany a man, if he stopped to reflect, would not be so ready to help to+undermine a religion, but would consider it the most sacred treasure ofthe people. If any one wants to criticise religion he should always bear+in mind the nature of the great masses for which it is destined, andpicture to himself their complete moral and intellectual inferiority. It+is incredible how far this inferiority goes and how steadily a spark oftruth will continue to glimmer even under the crudest veiling of+monstrous fables and grotesque ceremonies, adhering indelibly, like theperfume of musk, to everything which has come in contact with it. As an+illustration of this, look at the profound wisdom which is revealed inthe Upanishads, and then look at the mad idolatry in the India of+to-day, as is revealed in its pilgrimages, processions, and festivities,or at the mad and ludicrous doings of the Saniassi of the present time.+Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that in all this madness and absurditythere yet lies something that is hidden from view, something that is in+accordance with, or a reflection of the profound wisdom that has beenmentioned. It requires this kind of dressing-up for the great brute+masses. In this antithesis we have before us the two poles ofhumanity:--the wisdom of the individual and the bestiality of the+masses, both of which, however, find their point of harmony in the moralkingdom. Who has not thought of the saying from the Kurral--"Vulgar+people look like men; but I have never seen anything like them." Themore highly cultured man may always explain religion to himself _cum+grano salis_; the man of learning, the thoughtful mind, may, in secret,exchange it for a philosophy. And yet _one_ philosophy would not do for+everybody; each philosophy by the laws of affinity attracts a public towhose education and mental capacities it is fitted. So there is always+an inferior metaphysical system of the schools for the educatedplebeians, and a higher system for the _elite_. Kant's lofty doctrine,+for example, was degraded to meet the requirements of the schools, andruined by Fries, Krug, Salat, and similar people. In short, Goethe's+dictum is as applicable here as anywhere: _One does not suit all_. Purebelief in revelation and pure metaphysics are for the two extremes; and+for the intermediate steps mutual modifications of both in countlesscombinations and gradations. The immeasurable differences which nature+and education place between men have made this necessary.+_Phil._ This point of view reminds me seriously of the mysteries of theancients which you have already mentioned; their aim at bottom seems to+have lain in remedying the evil arising out of the differences of mentalcapacities and education. Their plan was to single out of the great+multitude a few people, to whom the unveiled truth was absolutelyincomprehensible, and to reveal the truth to them up to a certain point;+then out of these they singled out others to whom they revealed more, asthey were able to grasp more; and so on up to the Epopts. And so we got+[Greek: mikra, kai meizona, kai megista mystaeria]. The plan was basedon a correct knowledge of the intellectual inequality of mankind.+_Demop_. To a certain extent the education in our lower, middle, and+high schools represents the different forms of initiation into themysteries.+Back to Full Books
